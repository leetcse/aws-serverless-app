# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
```bash
npx create-react-app aws-serverless-app --template typescript
```

* Added launch.json file for debugging the [tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/debugging-tests/) 
* Run the app with `npm start`
* disable watch mode running tests `--watchAll=false`
